## Ten rules for proper test driven development

1. Write the test first: Always create your test before writing any implementation code.

2. Start simple: Begin with the simplest possible test case and gradually increase complexity.

3. Run the test and watch it fail: Ensure your test fails initially to confirm it's testing the right thing.

4. Write minimal code to pass the test: Implement just enough code to make the test pass, no more.

5. Refactor: Once the test passes, improve the code's structure without changing its functionality.

6. Keep tests small and focused: Each test should verify a single behavior or concept.

7. Use descriptive test names: Name your tests clearly to describe the behavior they're checking.

8. Maintain test independence: Tests should not depend on each other or share state.

9. Aim for high code coverage: Strive to test all code paths and edge cases.

10. Regularly run the entire test suite: Ensure all tests pass after each change to catch regressions.
